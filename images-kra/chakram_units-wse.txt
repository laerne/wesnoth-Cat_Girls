# This file defines what sprites to export from a .kra file using wesnoth_sprite_exporter
# Symbol `#` starts a comment until end of lines, anything in-between is ignored
#
# An export line is made of a file path and an extra tags sections, separated by `|` (and possible whitespaces)
# either of which can define a bunch of tags of the form {tag_name} or {tag_name=tag_value}
#
# tag_value can be a simple string or integer, but it also can be multiple comma-separated string values.
# It also can be one or multiple comma-separated non-negative integer ranges specified using a dash. E.g. `1-3,7,9-12`.
# When there are many possible values for some tags on a line, the exporter will iterate over all possible values.
# (Therefore one line might define multiple output files)
#
# The final filename is the name left of "|", stripped of whitespaces and with its tags replaced by its current tag value.
# If the path is relative, it is relative to the folder containing this file and the .kra file.
# In the case the tag has no associated tag_value, it is replaced with the tag itself.
